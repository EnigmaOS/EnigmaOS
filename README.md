## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is a Simple Website Hoster for esp32, with this you can host a site only with http on your local network, and access it with local IP or a domain by mDNS.
You can add 2 push buttons to gpio pins, one to stop and start the server, and another to change between White mode and Darkmode (only if you are using a SSD1306 i2c oled display)
Important! You will need to upload your website files to SPIFFS using Esp32 File Uploader!
